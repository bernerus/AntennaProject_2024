# YAYA - Yet Another Yagi Antenna
All details about my 2m antenna project 2024-2025

## 
Once in the mid 1990's my old 2x2 stack of 10 element WISI yagis for 2m
crashed irreparably in a storm. In order to remain on the air I built a 15 element yagi using a popular design by DJ9BV.
It worked, sort of, but wsn't at all that good as the WISI stack. One importanet difference was that its sheer length
made it impossible to attande any sort of elevetion, so no more EME experiments.

Over the years, my mast was extended to about 5 meters avove the garage roof, and steep guy wires was attached, and by 2022, now 
being retired, I realized that I could probably now have room for a 2x2 stack again if the antennae wasn't 8,5 meters long. 
The old elevation equipment and stacking kit was still being saved over the years, so I decided to empark on this project
to make new antennae.

## Mounting the elements
This far, in november 2024, I have done some progress. First thing was to design an element mount that kept the elements 
enough far from the boom in order not having to compensate for the boom when realizing and simulationg its performance.

To do that I purchsed a 3D printer. I wanted
to make element mounts in a plastic that does not deteriorate in UV light. The best material available for 3D printing 
is ASA. That called for a #D printed with a heated bed and at least 270Â°C nozzle temperature.
The AnkerMake M5C seemed to fit the requirements and matching the wallet.

### Open Source
I have used the OpenScad software for the design. I am (or was) a professional software developer after all before retiring.
This is why I'll publishing the OpenScad source code for the element mounts, hoping that they can be of use for others.
If you use them and make changes, do fork this repository and make those changers public.
